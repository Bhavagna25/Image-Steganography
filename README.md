# Image-Steganography
Image Steganography is a technique of hiding secret data (text, image, or file) inside an image without noticeable changes to the original image. It ensures secure communication by embedding the hidden message in pixel values, making it invisible to the human eye but retrievable with the right key or algorithm.
